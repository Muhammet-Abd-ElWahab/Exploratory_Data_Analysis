# Wine Quality Dataset investigate!

This project is from Udacity's Data Analysis Nanodegree professional track

### Overview:
This application is written with Python script using Numpy, Pandas and Matplotlib libraries to explore data from csv files
for red and white wine by:

*	Gathering, assessing and cleaning data trying to understand more details about it and identify any issues and modify the dataset for easy and fast analysis.
*	Explore this data and try to find patterns in it, compute statistics and visualize the relationships to answer the required questions and detect the characteristics that affect wine quality.

### The main target from this application is to find the characteristics which affect wine quality and answer these questions:

*  Which wine associated with better quality red wine or white wine?
*  What is the properties that associated with high quality wine?
*  What is the properties that associated with low quality wine?
*  Do wines with higher alcohol level have higher quality?
*  Do wines with higher residual sugar level have higher quality?
*  Do wines with higher pH level have higher quality?
*  Is there any correlation between density and quality?
*  Is there any correlation between alcohol and quality?
*  Is there any correlation between alcohol and density?
*  Is there any correlation between pH and quality?

### Dataset descriptions:

 The two datasets are related to red and white variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine. Due to privacy and logistic issues, only physicochemical (inputs) and sensory (the output) variables are available (e.g. there is no data about grape types, wine brand, wine selling price, etc).

### Dataset columns:

*   fixed acidity.
*   volatile acidity.
*   citric acid.
*   residual sugar.
*   chlorides.
*   free sulfur dioxide.
*   total sulfur dioxide.
*   density.
*   pH.
*   sulphates.
*   alcohol.
*   quality: Wine quality (score between 0 and 10).
